# P5Playground
A small collection of interesting web applications written for fun in P5 JS

## Physics

The physics webapp is a simple physics engine written in JavaScript suitable for expansion into a game. Currently only supports one particle but I am planning to rewrite it to make the program object-orientated allowing for more at some point in the future. 

Click to attract the particle, force varies by proximity.

## Diffusion-Limited Aggregation

Diffusion-limited aggregation is the process in which metal ion crystals form, the ions in solution behave randomly and attach on to the crystal when close enough. This is quite a slow simulation of this.

## Mandelbrot

The Mandelbrot webapp is a JavaScript implementation of a Mandelbrot set visualiser, if you find it to be too slow you can edit mandelbrot.js and reduce the max_iterations variable but this will lead to a loss of image clarity.


## TODO

* Audio visualiser
* Whatever I happen to come up with in future
